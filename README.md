# Ukrainian Cases

The ukrainian language has 7 cases, and it mostly works changing the ending of the word
in nominative.  
The idea of this program is that sending an ukrainian word, you get back all the 
different cases, including plural.

## Why?

I am learning ukrainian and clojure, so it is nice to mix some grammar with LISP.

## Usage

Visit https://ukrainiannouns.herokuapp.com/ to try it.

## API
For now there are 2 main functions, you can try the API here:  
https://ukrainian-cases-api.herokuapp.com  

* https://ukrainian-cases-api.herokuapp.com/nouns/<ukrainian_noun>/gender
* https://ukrainian-cases-api.herokuapp.com/nouns/<ukrainian_noun>/nominative  

The API is also build with clojure using Compojure
