# Ukrainian Cases

The ukrainian language has 7 cases, and it mostly works changing the ending of the word
in nominative.  
The idea of this program is that sending an ukrainian word, you get back all the 
different cases, including plural.

## Why?

I am learning ukrainian and clojure, so it is nice to mix some grammar with LISP.

## Usage

For now there are 2 main functions, both for nominative.  
You can use it in Java calling the wrapper, or direct in clojure:  

get-possible-genders-nominative (clojure)
getGendersNominative (java)

To use clojure follow these tutorials:
